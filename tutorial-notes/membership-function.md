## Membership function

Let's explore the concept of overlapping membership. To do this, we will consider the object/term octagon as an example. The term "octagon" can be classified in terms of its shape, and can be fit into either a standard continuum between extremes (square-round), or as a degree of a single term (round). In the first case, "octagon" is 50% round and 50% square when the shape criterion is used. In the second case, "octagon" is 50% of a single term (round).

Another way to approach overlapping membership is to use multiple attributes for the same classification. To demonstrate this, we can use a "square" with a curved surface. While the 2-D shape is clearly square, the surface curvature (3-D) is partially circular. The classification is 100% square and 50% circle. This changes the nature of the continuum from an oppositional data structure to a fuzzy one. As we will see, this has consequences on whether or not the classification structure is dependent or independent.

In cases where the membership function is dependent, one dimension produces a 1-tuple, so that there is only one relevant number for each dimension. For dependent membership in the light-dark category, 30% light is 70% dark. A value of light = 0.3 is dark = 1-0.3. However, we can have cases where the oppositions are independent -- that is, where the degree of membership for each dimension pole is not n, 1-n. In such a case, the phenomenon being classified has a value of light = 0.3 and dark = 0.3. This will often result from a multitude of meanings for each term or object.
