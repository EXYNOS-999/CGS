Installation

1.) pull git repo
2.) if not already installed, download python3.6 and pip
3.) run build.sh by typing ./build.sh into terminal - make sure you are in proper directory


Input Instructions

The Input file has 6 inputs which change the outcome of the simulation. I will go through them line by line

Line 1:
The first line tells you how many years, (and subsequently, how many generations), your simulation will run for

Line 2:
Line 2 is where you input the tuples you want for the simulation

Line 3:
Line 3 is where you input the number of cultures you want in your simulation.

Line 4:

Line 4 is if you want to see the tuples frequency information over time with google n-grams

Line 5:

Line 5 is where you clarify which type of machine learning you want to use. Right now the possibilities include
knn.py
genetic_algorithm.py

which you can see in the repo folder

Line 6:
Line 6 is where you input the number of frames you want to represent each generation during the simulation
